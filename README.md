# Welcome to Physics_Sandbox:

Physics_Sandbox is a remarkable project created by a team of four students, including myself. With a strong emphasis on both functional and object-oriented programming, this project offers a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can play with 2D shapes and witness their behavior through realistic simulations of basic interactions like collisions and gravity.

With an intuitive interface, you'll effortlessly navigate through the application, unleashing your creativity and exploring the limitless possibilities of 2D simulations. Whether you are a novice or an experienced programmer, Physics_Sandbox is designed to cater to all skill levels, making it accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

By blending the principles of functional and object-oriented programming, we have created a harmonious fusion that optimizes the strengths of both paradigms. Embrace the elegance and conciseness of functional programming, allowing you to write clean and efficient code that is easy to reason about. Meanwhile, embrace the flexibility and modularity offered by object-oriented programming, empowering you to create robust and extensible simulations.

Furthermore, the influence of gravity elegantly affects the motion of objects, creating a mesmerizing dance of shapes across the screen. Each interaction is thoughtfully crafted to provide a rich and immersive experience, fueling your curiosity and sparking your creativity.
